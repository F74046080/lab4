A	Use nm to the program,showing that
0000000000400624 T _Z7averagePdRd
0000000000400652 T _Z7averageif

It showed that the first average function the argument are Pointer double and Reference double. And the second function are integer and float.

B	This program show that
1 8
4 8
4 8
8 8

It show that sizeof char=1, integer=4, float=4, double=4 obviously. But why is the sizeof pointer of them =8? Because pointers store memory addresses, and memory addresses are integers, In the 64bit-computer the sizeof pointer is 8 byte(64/8).
